  <h2>PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h2>
  <p>As a microbiology analyst with extensive experience, I am seeking a career 
    transition to web development to further develop my skills and pursue new 
    challenges. I'm good at paying attention to details and figuring things out. 
    In my previous job, I did experiments and analyzed data, and I presented my 
    findings to others. I've learned the basics of web development, like making 
    web pages and working with databases. I'm ready to bring my skills and love 
    for problem-solving to build cool websites and apps.</p>

  <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>BSc (Hons) Biomedical Sciences at University of Reading, Reading (Sep13 - Jul16)</h3></li>
      <h4>Dissertation:</h4>
      <p>“Rap1A, a small GTPase clustering with integrin B3 on resting and 
        activated platelets”</p>
      <h4>Research experience</h4>  
      <p>My final year research involved the activation of integrin B3 mediated by small 
        GTPase Rap1A. To understand the dynamic colocalizations of rap1A and integrin B3, 
        platelets stained with antibody against integrin were incubated and fixed at 
        various times intervals. During the research, I used direct stochastic optical 
        reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Using dSTORM, I was able to map a highly 
        precise platelet images that allowed me to observe the distribution of rap1A and 
        integrin beta 3 on the platelet surface during its resting and activated state. 
        Through this study on integrin clustering and colocalization of rap1 and integrin, 
        I was able to understand the relevance of Rap1A in integrin regulation; and 
        platelet adhesion and aggregation.</p> 
      <p>I further developed scientific experimentation skills on handling lab instruments 
        with analytical skills and data interpretation skills using statistics. The 
        research also made be conversant on data analysis and enhanced my presentation 
        skills.</p>
